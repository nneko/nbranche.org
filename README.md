# nbranche theme for ghost

A minimalist blog theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and the default visual style for [nbranche.org](http://nbranche.org). The design is best suited for traditional blogs relying on the chronological stream format that wish to display the post content inline.

Full post content is displayed directly in the index and the focus is on showcasing the written content at the expense of heavy visual imagery and big splashy covers or feature images which is used by other design paradigms as the primary means to introduce/highlight a new post.
